Note of 20150413 : This fork of the original Rails 3.2 example application for a “beta launching soon” startup prelaunch signup site, is currently being updated to Rails 4.2.1 Ruby 2.2.1.

Please refer to the original materials : 

* "Rails Prelaunch Signup App":http://railsapps.github.io/rails-prelaunch-signup/ project page

Best of all, there's a "detailed tutorial":https://tutorials.railsapps.org/rails-prelaunch-signup to show how it is built. Go 'Hobo' for free access.

You can build this application in only a few minutes using the "Rails Composer":http://railsapps.github.io/rails-composer/ tool.
