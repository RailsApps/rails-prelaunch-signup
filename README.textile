h1. Rails Prelaunch Signup for a Startup

Rails 3.2 "beta launching soon" example application that shows how to create a Rails application for a startup prelaunch signup site.

*This app is in development. It is not finished. Click GitHub "Watch" to follow progress. Or follow  "@rails_apps":http://twitter.com/rails_apps on Twitter for project announcements.*

You can clone this app or generate a new Rails application from this app's template.

This application is for Rails developers who want to build and deploy their own prelaunch site. The application is very simple and any experienced Rails developer could easily build it. The aim of the project is to eliminate individual effort spent building an application that meets a common need. As an open source project, you can use code that is already implemented and tested. Your individual effort can be better applied to add features to your prelaunch app, customize the look and functionality of your prelaunch site, and get started on a real application for a launch.

Best of all, there's a "detailed tutorial":http://railsapps.github.com/tutorial-rails-prelaunch-signup.html to show how it is built.

"Devise":http://github.com/plataformatec/devise gives us ready-made authentication and user management. It is easy to build "authentication from scratch":http://railscasts.com/episodes/250-authentication-from-scratch for a Rails application. It is even easier to build an application that simply saves email addresses to a database. We'll use Devise because it offers a full set of features used in more complex applications, such as recovering a user's forgotten password. By using Devise for the prelaunch signup application, you can use the same user database for a post-launch site.

Devise handles signing up users through a registration feature. We use the Devise registration process to collect email addresses and create user accounts. Instead of confirming an email address immediately, we email a "thank you for your request" acknowledgment and mark the user account as "inactive." When you are ready to invite users to try your site (either in beta or post-launch) you can mark the account as "active" and send the user an email invitation.

This app uses the "rails3-devise-rspec-cucumber":https://github.com/RailsApps/rails3-devise-rspec-cucumber  example app as a starter app. You can see a "tutorial for the rails3-devise-rspec-cucumber example app":http://railsapps.github.com/tutorial-rails-devise-rspec-cucumber.html to see how the starter app is built.

h2. !http://railsapps.github.com/images/rails-36x36.jpg(Tutorial)! Tutorial

A complete walkthrough tutorial is available on the GitHub wiki:

h4. "View the Tutorial":http://railsapps.github.com/tutorial-rails-prelaunch-signup.html

The tutorial documents each step to follow to create the application. Every step is documented concisely, so a complete beginner can create this application without any additional knowledge. However, no explanation is offered for any of the steps, so if you are a beginner, you’re advised to look for an introduction to Rails elsewhere. See a list of recommended resources for "Rails":http://railsapps.github.com/rails.html.

If you simply wish to modify the application for your own project, you can download the application and set it up as described below, without following the tutorial.

h2. Dependencies

Before generating your application, you will need:

* The Ruby language (version 1.9.3)
* Rails 3.2

See "Installing Rails 3.2":http://railsapps.github.com/installing-rails.html for detailed instructions and advice.

h2. Getting the Application

You have several options for getting the code.

h4. Fork, Clone, or Generate?

_Fork:_ If you'd like to add features (or bug fixes) to improve the app for others to use as a prelaunch signup site, you can fork the GitHub repo and make pull requests. Your code contributions are welcome!

_Clone:_ If you want to copy and customize the app with changes that are only useful for your own project, you can clone the GitHub repo. You'll need to search-and-replace the project name throughout the application. You probably should generate the app instead (see below).

_Generate:_ If you want to use the project as a starter app for your customized application, use the application template to generate a new version of the example app. You'll be able to give it your project name when you generate the app. _Note: Unfortunately, the application template isn't available yet. In the meantime, follow the steps in the Tutorial to create your own version of the project._

h4. Clone the Repository

If you simply wish to examine the example code, you can download the code ("clone the repository") with the command

<pre>
$ git clone git://github.com/RailsApps/rails-prelaunch-signup.git
</pre>

The source code is managed with Git (a version control system). You'll need Git on your machine (install it from "http://git-scm.com/":http://git-scm.com/).

h4. Please Remember: Edit the README

If you're open sourcing the app on GitHub, please edit the README file to add a description of the app and your contact info. Changing the README is important if you're using a clone of the example app. I've been mistaken (and contacted) as the author of apps that are copied from my example.

h2. Getting Started

h4. About Required Gems

The application uses the following gems:

* "rails":http://rubygems.org/gems/rails
* "rspec-rails":http://rubygems.org/gems/rspec-rails
* "database_cleaner":http://rubygems.org/gems/database_cleaner
* "factory_girl_rails":http://rubygems.org/gems/factory_girl_rails
* "cucumber-rails":http://rubygems.org/gems/cucumber-rails
* "capybara":http://rubygems.org/gems/capybara
* "devise":http://rubygems.org/gems/devise

h4. Install the Required Gems

Install the required gems on your computer:

@$ bundle install@

You can check which gems are installed on your computer with:

@$ gem list --local@

Keep in mind that you have installed these gems locally. When you deploy the app to another server, the same gems (and versions) must be available.

h4. Set Up Configuration for Devise

This app uses "Devise":http://github.com/plataformatec/devise for user management and authentication.

You can modify the configuration file for Devise if you want to use something other than the defaults:

*config/initializers/devise.rb*

h4. Configure Email for Devise

Configure email by modifying

*config/initializers/devise.rb*

and setting the return email address for emails sent from the application.

You may need to set values for your mailhost in

*config/environments/development.rb*
*config/environments/production.rb*

h2. Create a Default User

h4. Set Up a Database Seed File

You'll want to set up a default user so you can easily log in to test the app. You can modify the file *db/seeds.rb* for your own name, email and password:

<pre>
puts 'SETTING UP DEFAULT USER LOGIN'
user = User.create! :name => 'First User', :email => 'user@example.com', :password => 'please', :password_confirmation => 'please'
puts 'New user created: ' << user.name
</pre>

Use the defaults or change the values for name, email, and password as you wish.

h4. Seed the Database

Add the default user to the database by running the command:

@$ rake db:migrate@
@$ rake db:seed@

h4. Test the App

You can check that your app runs properly by entering the command

@$ rails server@

To see your application in action, open a browser window and navigate to "http://localhost:3000/":http://localhost:3000. You should see the default user listed on the home page. When you click on the user's name, you should be required to log in before seeing the user's detail page.

To sign in as the default user, (unless you've changed it) use

* email: user@example.com
* password: please

You should delete or change the pre-configured logins before you deploy your application.

h2. Deploy to Heroku

For your convenience, here are instructions for "deploying your app to Heroku":http://railsapps.github.com/rails-heroku-tutorial.html. Heroku provides low cost, easily configured Rails application hosting.

h2. Testing

The application contains RSpec unit tests and Cucumber scenarios and steps. The tests are minimal and can be improved.

Please send the author a message, create an issue, or submit a pull request if you can contribute improved RSpec or Cucumber files.

After installing the application, run @rake -T@ to check that rake tasks for RSpec and Cucumber are available.

Run @rake spec@ to run all RSpec tests.

Run @rake cucumber@ (or more simply, @cucumber@) to run all Cucumber scenarios and steps.
