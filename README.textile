h1. !http://railsapps.github.com/images/rails-36x36.jpg(Rails App for a Startup Prelaunch Signup Site)! Rails App for a Startup Prelaunch Signup Site

Rails 3.2 "beta launching soon" example application that shows how to create a Rails application for a startup prelaunch signup site.

You can clone this app or generate a new Rails application from this app's template.

Best of all, there's a "detailed tutorial":http://railsapps.github.com/tutorial-rails-prelaunch-signup.html to show how it is built.

h2. Introduction

The initial app for a typical web startup announces the founders' plans and encourages visitors to enter an email address for future notification of the site's launch. It's not difficult to build such an app in Rails.

But why build it yourself if others have already done so? This project aims to:

* eliminate effort spent building an application that meets a common need;
* offer code that is already implemented and tested by a large community;
* provide a well-thought-out app containing most of the features you'll need.

By using code from this project, you'll be able to:

* direct your attention to the design and product offer for your prelaunch site;
* get started faster building the ultimate application for your business.

The "tutorial":http://railsapps.github.com/tutorial-rails-prelaunch-signup.html can help founders who are new to Ruby on Rails to learn how to build a real-world Rails web application.

h3. Why We Use Devise

We've chosen to use the "Devise":http://github.com/plataformatec/devise gem for our authentication and user management. We use Devise because it offers a full set of features used in more complex applications, such as recovering a user's forgotten password or allowing users to invite friends. By using Devise for the prelaunch signup application, you can use the same user database for your post-launch product. You'll also have the benefit of receiving help from a large community of developers using Devise, should you need help in troubleshooting or customizing the implementation.

h3. How We Configure Devise

Devise offers many features and configuration choices; in fact, exploring its options can take more time than actually implementing authentication from scratch. This app will save you time; we've selected the configuration that best accommodates a typical web startup signup site.

Devise handles signing up users through a registration feature. We use the Devise registration process to collect email addresses and create user accounts. Instead of confirming an email address immediately, we email a "thank you for your request" acknowledgment and postpone the email confirmation step. When you are ready to invite users to the site, the app provides an administrative interface so you can select users to receive an invitation that instructs them to confirm their email address and set a password.

The "Devise wiki":https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/wiki and "answers on Stack Overflow":http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/devise can help you alter this implementation if you need different functionality.

h3. RailsApps Examples and Tutorials

This is one in a series of Rails example apps and tutorials from the "RailsApps Project":http://railsapps.github.com/.

This application is based on two of the RailsApps example apps:

* "rails3-devise-rspec-cucumber":https://github.com/RailsApps/rails3-devise-rspec-cucumber 
* "rails3-bootstrap-devise-cancan":https://github.com/RailsApps/rails3-bootstrap-devise-cancan

The rails3-devise-rspec-cucumber app shows how to set up Devise for user authentication, explaining how to integrate RSpec and Cucumber for testing. The rails3-bootstrap-devise-cancan app shows how to set up Devise and add CanCan to manage access to administrative pages. You can use this example without studying these example applications; if you find you are lost, it may be helpful to look at the two simpler examples. 

Look at "rails3-mongoid-devise":https://github.com/RailsApps/rails3-mongoid-devise example if you want to use the MongoDB datastore instead of ActiveRecord and a SQL database.

Any issues? Please create a "GitHub issue":http://github.com/RailsApps/rails-prelaunch-signup/issues.

h2. Tutorial

A complete walkthrough tutorial is available on the GitHub wiki:

h4. "View the Tutorial":http://railsapps.github.com/tutorial-rails-prelaunch-signup.html

The tutorial documents each step to follow to create the application. Every step is documented concisely, so a complete beginner can create this application without any additional knowledge. However, no explanation is offered for any of the steps, so if you are a beginner, you’re advised to look for an introduction to Rails elsewhere. See a list of recommended resources for "Rails":http://railsapps.github.com/rails.html.

If you simply wish to modify the application for your own project, you can download the application and set it up as described below, without following the tutorial.

h2. What Is Implemented — and What Is Not

Currently, the application only serves to display a landing page with a form for visitors to request invitations. Visitors' email addresses are collected in the application's database. An administrator can view the collected email addresses.

If there is interest, the author and contributors will implement additional features. See below for a list of implemented and proposed user stories.

h3. User Stories (Implemented)

h2. Dependencies

Before generating your application, you will need:

* The Ruby language (version 1.9.3)
* Rails 3.2

See "Installing Rails 3.2":http://railsapps.github.com/installing-rails.html for detailed instructions and advice.

h2. Getting the Application

You have several options for getting the code.

h3. Fork, Clone, or Generate?

_Fork:_ If you'd like to add features (or bug fixes) to improve the app for others to use as a prelaunch signup site, you can fork the GitHub repo and "make pull requests":http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/. Your code contributions are welcome!

_Clone:_ If you want to copy and customize the app with changes that are only useful for your own project, you can clone the GitHub repo. You'll need to search-and-replace the project name throughout the application. You probably should generate the app instead (see below).

_Generate:_ If you want to use the project as a starter app for your customized application, use the application template to generate a new version of the example app. You'll be able to give it your project name when you generate the app. _Note: Unfortunately, the application template isn't available yet. In the meantime, follow the steps in the Tutorial to create your own version of the project._

h3. Clone the Repository

If you simply wish to examine the example code, you can download the code ("clone the repository") with the command

<pre>
$ git clone git://github.com/RailsApps/rails-prelaunch-signup.git
</pre>

The source code is managed with Git (a version control system). You'll need Git on your machine (install it from "http://git-scm.com/":http://git-scm.com/).

h4. Please Remember: Edit the README

If you're open sourcing the app on GitHub, please edit the README file to add a description of the app and your contact info. Changing the README is important if you're using a clone of the example app. I've been mistaken (and contacted) as the author of apps that are copied from my example.

h2. Getting Started

h3. About Required Gems

The application uses the following gems:

* "rails":http://rubygems.org/gems/rails
* "rspec-rails":http://rubygems.org/gems/rspec-rails
* "database_cleaner":http://rubygems.org/gems/database_cleaner
* "factory_girl_rails":http://rubygems.org/gems/factory_girl_rails
* "cucumber-rails":http://rubygems.org/gems/cucumber-rails
* "capybara":http://rubygems.org/gems/capybara
* "devise":http://rubygems.org/gems/devise

h3. Install the Required Gems

Install the required gems on your computer:

@$ bundle install@

You can check which gems are installed on your computer with:

@$ gem list --local@

Keep in mind that you have installed these gems locally. When you deploy the app to another server, the same gems (and versions) must be available.

h3. Set Up Configuration for Devise

This app uses "Devise":http://github.com/plataformatec/devise for user management and authentication.

You can modify the configuration file for Devise if you want to use something other than the defaults:

*config/initializers/devise.rb*

h3. Configure Email for Devise

Configure email by modifying

*config/initializers/devise.rb*

and setting the return email address for emails sent from the application.

You may need to set values for your mailhost in

*config/environments/development.rb*
*config/environments/production.rb*

h2. Create a Default User

h3. Set Up a Database Seed File

You'll want to set up a default user so you can easily log in to test the app. You can modify the file *db/seeds.rb* for your own name, email and password:

<pre>
puts 'SETTING UP DEFAULT USER LOGIN'
user = User.create! :name => 'First User', :email => 'user@example.com', :password => 'please', :password_confirmation => 'please'
puts 'New user created: ' << user.name
</pre>

Use the defaults or change the values for name, email, and password as you wish.

h3. Seed the Database

Add the default user to the database by running the command:

@$ rake db:migrate@
@$ rake db:seed@

h3. Test the App

You can check that your app runs properly by entering the command

@$ rails server@

To see your application in action, open a browser window and navigate to "http://localhost:3000/":http://localhost:3000. You should see the default user listed on the home page. When you click on the user's name, you should be required to log in before seeing the user's detail page.

To sign in as the default user, (unless you've changed it) use

* email: user@example.com
* password: please

You should delete or change the pre-configured logins before you deploy your application.

h2. Deploy to Heroku

For your convenience, here are instructions for "deploying your app to Heroku":http://railsapps.github.com/rails-heroku-tutorial.html. Heroku provides low cost, easily configured Rails application hosting.

h2. Testing

The application contains RSpec unit tests and Cucumber scenarios and steps. The tests are minimal and can be improved.

Please send the author a message, create an issue, or submit a pull request if you can contribute improved RSpec or Cucumber files.

After installing the application, run @rake -T@ to check that rake tasks for RSpec and Cucumber are available.

Run @rake spec@ to run all RSpec tests.

Run @rake cucumber@ (or more simply, @cucumber@) to run all Cucumber scenarios and steps.
